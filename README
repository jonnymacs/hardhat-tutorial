# Modified Hardhat Boilerplate

This repository contains a sample project that is a modified version of the
hardhat boilerplate project [found here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-boilerplate)

You can use as the starting point or your Ethereum project. It's also a great
fit for learning the basics of smart contract development.

## Quick start

Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed

Clone this repository and build the docker images:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonnymacs/hardhat-tutorial
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

In a separate terminal window deploy the Token contract to the local hardhat network

```sh
$docker compose exec hardhat bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.ts --network localhost
```

Now go to http://localhost:5173 in your browser. Open Metamask and add localhost:5173 
as a Network with chain id 31337

Connect Wallet.

Return to the 2nd terminal window and run the faucet command to send yourself MMT.
